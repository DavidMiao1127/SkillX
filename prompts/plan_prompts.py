Your job is to analyze an agent's API interaction history and the user's task, then distill them into a concise, reusable plan. This plan should serve as a reference for handling similar tasks more effectively in the future.

# OBJECTIVES
1. **Understand Capabilities**
   - Analyze the recorded API calls to identify the actual functional capabilities demonstrated.

2. **Abstract into a Plan**
    - For each feasible task supported by those capabilities, produce a concise, reusable step-by-step plan that can be applied to similar tasks.

---

# Planning Creation Rules

## 1. Focus
- Do not simply restate each API function step-by-step using technical jargon. Instead, describe the underlying sub-goal behind each action segment.

## 2. Remove Non-Essential Steps
- Exclude capability exploration, debugging, and failed steps.

## 3. Reusability
- The plan must be precise enough for other models to reuse.

## 4. Conciseness
- Merge steps from the interaction history that share the same objective into a single sub-step in the plan.
- Use a compact writing style for each sub-step, while listing the key APIs involved in that step (one or more).
- Do not omit any critical, potentially required API keys.

# OUTPUT FORMAT
For each task, output exactly one plan and follow this format strictly:

<plan>
# step 1: A natural, specific, concise sub-task goal; key APIs used (one or more).
# step 2: ...
...
</plan>

---

# GOOD EXAMPLES
<plan>
# step 1: Authenticate so you can access the user's library and likes; key APIs used: apis.spotify.login
# step 2: Retrieve the full set of liked songs by paging through results until no more items are returned; key APIs used: apis.spotify.show_liked_songs
# step 3: For each liked song, fetch its metadata and extract the genre field; key APIs used: apis.spotify.show_song
# step 4: Aggregate liked-song counts by genre (and optionally compute percentages / top-N) to identify the most-liked genre; key APIs used: (none—local aggregation)
# step 5: Return the result; key APIs used: apis.supervisor.complete_task
</plan>

---

# CHECKLIST BEFORE FINALIZING
✅ **Reusability** — Ensure no critical steps are missing and the step order is correct.
✅ **Conciseness** — Confirm there are no redundant or unnecessary steps.
✅ **Agent-centered** — Make sure the plan reads like actionable instructions that other models can reliably follow.

PLAN_COMBINE_PROMPTS = {
    "default": """You are a **Planning Expert**.
Your job is to combine the plans created by other planning experts for the same task into a final plan.

---

# OBJECTIVES
1. **Understand Capabilities**
- Analyze each expert's plan to identify the recurring workflow patterns across them, while also noting any workflow branches that differ due to variations in user profiles.

2. **Think Like an Agent**
- Imagine another agent facing a similar task: it should be able to directly reuse the plan you created to complete the task—without unnecessary trial-and-error or pointless exploration.

---

# Planning Combination Rules

## 1. Reusability:
- The plan must be precise enough for other models to reuse.

## 2. Optimality:
- Different plans may represent multiple feasible ways to complete the task. Keep only the best approach. **Best** means concise and effective.
- Do not omit any critical, potentially required API keys.

## 3. Multi-conditionality:
- When multiple workflow branches exist, merge them thoughtfully to maximize coverage of edge cases, boundary conditions, and decision points.
- Otherwise, you should adhere to the optimality principle.

# step 5: If cards also fail due to insufficient funds, check balance and attempt to add funds from a card, then retry the payment; key APIs used: apis.venmo.show_venmo_balance, apis.venmo.add_to_venmo_balance, apis.venmo.create_transaction
